## Week 3 Review Questions

1. Linear Algebra: Instantiate matrices A and B, and vector x like:
  ``` python
  A = np.random.randint(0, 50, size=(4, 4))
  B = np.random.randint(0, 50, size=(4, 3))
  x = np.random.randint(0, 50, size=(20, ))
  ```
  Note that the answers will all be different because you have used random numbers to create the matrices. The important piece here is the code to perform the operation. These should all be one line of code

  * Return only the elements of x that are even.

  * Multiply matrices A and B.

  * Compute the inverse of A. Can B be inverted? Why or why not?

  * Compute the euclidean distance between rows 1 and 3 of matrix A.

  * Compute the cosine similarity between columns 1 and 2 of matrix A.

  * Find the matrix C such that B * C = A (write C in terms of A and B)

  * Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A. Describe what eigenvalues and eigenvectors tell you.

2. What are the assumptions behind OLS linear regression?

3. What are some metrics for linear regression goodness of fit, and what do they mean?

4. In the context of machine learning, what are bias and variance?  And what is the bias-variance trade-off?

5. Explain what kFold cross-validation is and why it's used.

6. What is the curse of dimensionality?  How is it addressed?

7. We talked about L1 and L2 regularization.  What are they and in what situations might one be used instead of the other?

8. Draw a confusion matrix for binary predictions.

9. Give an example for each case:
  * Precision is more important than recall.

  * Recall is more important than precision.

  * You consider both to be important (and what metric would you use for that?)

10. How is a ROC curve generated?  What does it show?

11. What are the similarities and differences between linear and logistic regression regression and how do you interpret the coefficients in each case?

12. SQL: Given table `houses` below, write a query to...

| id | sqft | beds | neighborhood | type | sale_price |
|:----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 | 1150 | 2 | prospect-park | townhome | 244052 |
| 2 | 2600 | 3 | calhoun-isles | single_family | 609536 |
| 3 | 860 | 1 | uptown | condo | 472993 |
| 4 | 1320 | 3 | north-loop | townhome | 309485 |
| 5 | 1030 | 2 | downtown | townhome | 456141 |
| 6 | 3000 | 3 | uptown | single_family | 544431 |
| 7 | 1400 | 2 | longfellow | condo | 305314 |
| 8 | 3000 | 4 | longfellow | single_family | 485802 |
| 9 | 1700 | 3 | stephens-square | single_family | 337029 |

  * Return the average number of bedrooms and square footage for each type of home.

  * Return the average sale price for each  neighborhood and home type.
